Picross Games 
Developed a game that uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) across the application as well as the Java Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) and Swing for the game's GUI.
In order to reduce complexity and preserve well-organized, clean code, the game was also developed using the Model-View-Controller design(MVC).
